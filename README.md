## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an optimized layout across different screen sizes.
- See interactive hover states.
- Submit a form with validation to ensure correct email format.
- Receive real-time error messages for invalid or empty inputs.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS (Styled Components, TailwindCSS, or custom styling)
- Flexbox & Grid
- React.js & Next.js (if applicable)
- Form validation (Yup, Zod, or vanilla JavaScript validation)
- API integration (if applicable)

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I reinforced my understanding of:

- Responsive design principles.
- Form validation techniques using [validation library or custom logic].
- Managing state effectively in React.
- Best practices for accessibility and user experience.

Example code snippet:

```js
const validateEmail = (email) => {
  const re = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return re.test(email);
};
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to:

- Optimize performance by minimizing re-renders.
- Implement additional form validation enhancements.
- Explore more accessibility improvements.
